Ph.D. in Computer Science, University of Nevada, Las Vegas

I received my BS and one MS from the Al. I. Cuza University, Iasi, Romania, another MS and my PhD from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, all in Computer Science.

After graduating, in Fall 2006 I was a visiting scholar at Osaka University, Japan. Starting January 2007, I was Research Associate at The University of Texas at Dallas. In 2008 I joined the Applied Research Laboratory, The Pennsylvania State University, as research faculty. From Fall 2013 until May 2015, I was part-time instructor at The University of Nevada, Las Vegas.

In August 2015, I joined California State University, Fullerton, as assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science. In August 2019, I became Associate Professor in Computer Science.

I authored over 100 book chapters, journals, research and survey papers. 
I was the co-PI for an Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR) grant ”Dynamic Data Driven Machine Perception and Learning for Border Control” ($1,068,215; 2012-2017) and PI for a DURIP AFOSR grant ($85,326; 2016-2018) “Environmental-aware Situation Assessment of Cognitive Autonomous Systems”). I am co-PI of an ongoing NSF grant ($1,496,967; 2018-2023) “Building Capacity: Advancing Student Success in Undergraduate Engineering and Computer Science” on advancing undergraduate research.
I am the associate editor for two journals and Academic Editor for the Journal of Advances in Mathematics and Computer Science (former name: British Journal of Mathematics and Computer Science). I served as a publicity chair, committee member on many conferences and workshops and was the reviewer for numerous conferences and journals.
